# Komopaper
Komopaper is a wallpaper switcher for Komorebi that allows you to set custom wallpapers per workspace. It supports both native windows wallpapers and Wallpaper Engine. See the provided config.json for how to configure. Make sure to have as many elements in the monitors array as you have on your desktop. It's perfectly ok to leave a monitors element empty, Komopaper will ignore it then.

## Todo
Make it so you can rotate between multiple wallpapers in a single workspace.
